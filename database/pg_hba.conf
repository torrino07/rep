# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================
#
# Refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the PostgreSQL documentation
# for a complete description of this file. A short synopsis follows.
#
# This file controls: which hosts are allowed to connect, how clients
# are authenticated, which PostgreSQL user names they can use, which
# databases they can access. Records take one of these forms:
#
# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# host       DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
#
# The first field is the connection type: "local" is a Unix-domain socket,
# "host" is either a plain or SSL-encrypted TCP/IP socket,
# "hostssl" is an SSL-encrypted TCP/IP socket,
# "hostnossl" is a plain TCP/IP socket.
#
# The database field can be "all", "sameuser", "samerole", "replication",
# a database name, or a comma-separated list thereof.
#
# The user field can be "all", a user name, a group name prefixed with "+",
# or a comma-separated list thereof.
#
# The address field is either a CIDR-style address, a host name that
# resolves to a CIDR address, or a comma-separated list thereof.
#
# The method field is the authentication method to use.  Supported methods:
# trust, reject, md5, scram-sha-256, password, gss, sspi, ident, peer, pam,
# ldap, radius, cert, bsd
#
# OPTIONS are a set of options for the authentication in the format
# NAME=VALUE. Refer to the documentation for a list of available options.
#
# Database and user names containing spaces, commas, quotes, or other special
# characters must be quoted. Quoting one of the keywords "all", "replication",
# "sameuser", or "samerole" makes the name lose its special character, and
# just match a database or username with that name.

# Put your actual configuration here

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     peer
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256

# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
local   replication     all                                     peer
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
